# Nimcure - Drug Prescription Delivery Service

This is a **Next.js** project built as part of the **Front-end Engineer Track**. The application is a **drug prescription delivery service** for a medical facility, allowing pharmacy attendants to:

- **Initiate a delivery** for a new prescription.
- **Renew prescriptions** for patients.
- Ensure a **smooth and efficient** ordering experience, just like in a physical pharmacy.

> **Note:** This project is **purely static**, meaning all functionalities, including scanning, are just UI representations without backend logic.
